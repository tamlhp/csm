Abstract: Event detection is hindered by the sheer amount of available social media data and its unstructured, free-text representation. In this work, we develop an end-to-end framework that facilitates the event detection process by offering text processing and mining operators for analyzing and grouping raw data across different dimensions. The analytic findings focus on a case study in Twitter data. Our framework can be extended to other textual corpora as well as publicly available for further performance evaluation and functionality integration.
